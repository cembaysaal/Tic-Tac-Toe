# TicTacToe
 
This is a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using Python's tkinter library for the GUI. The game allows players to play against two different AI algorithms: a basic rule-based algorithm and a more advanced heuristic using the A* search.

## Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/cembaysaal/Tic-Tac-Toe

# Navigate to the directory:
cd Tic-Tac-Toe

# Run the game:
python main.py

## Controls
Once the game window opens, choose the desired AI algorithm using the radio buttons at the top.

Start the game by clicking on any cell to place the 'X'. The AI will automatically make its move, placing the 'O'.

The game will announce the winner once there's a win condition met or if it's a tie. Click anywhere on the board to reset the game and play again.
